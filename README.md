### Example usage
#### Capture with [hackrf](https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/) or [rad1o](https://rad1o.badge.events.ccc.de/start) and multiprocessing

Note: The rad1o has to be in hackrf-mode

    hackrf_transfer -f 1625800000 -a 1 -l 40 -g 20 -s 2000000 -r /dev/fd3 3>&1 1>&2 | python2 extractor.py -c 1625800000 -r 2000000 -f hackrf --jobs 2 | fgrep "A:OK" >> output.bits

If you built/installed the rad1o branch of the hackrf tools, add `-S 26214400` to the commandline like this:

    hackrf_transfer -f 1625800000 -a 1 -l 40 -g 20 -s 2000000 -S 26214400 -r /dev/fd3 3>&1 1>&2 | python2 extractor.py -c 1625800000 -r 2000000 -f hackrf --jobs 2 | fgrep "A:OK" >> output.bits

This writes to `output.bits`. Iridium frames can be decoded with

    python2 iridium-parser.py output.bits

if you want to speed up that step you can install `pypy` and instead run 

    pypy iridium-parser.py output.bits

### Extracting Iridium packets from raw data

To capture and demodulate Iridium packets use `extractor.py`. You can either process
a file offline or stream data into the tool.

#### Command line options:

##### `-o`, `--offline`: Process a file offline
By default, the extractor will drop samples if the computing power available is
not enough to keep up. If you have an already recorded file, use the `-o`,`--offline`
option to not drop any samples. In this case the extractor will pause reading the
file (or input stream) until it can process more samples again.

##### `-q`: Queue length
The internal queue is filled with samples where the detector has detected activity
in the file. By default it is 12000 elements long (roughly 4 GB at 2 Maps). You can
tweak the length of the queue with this option

##### `-c`: Center frequency
The center frequency of the samples data in Hz.

##### `-r`: Sample rate
The sample rate of the samples in sps

##### `-f`: Input file format
| File Format                                        | `extractor.py` format option |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| complex uint8 (RTLSDR)                             | `rtl`                        |
| complex int8 (hackrf, rad1o)                       | `hackrf`                     |
| complex int16 (USRP with specrec from gr-analysis) | `sc16`                       |
| complex float (GNURadio, `uhd_rx_cfile`)           | `float`                      |

##### `-j`, `--jobs`
The number of processes to spawn which demodulate packets. The detector runs in the main
process.

### Voice Decoding
To listen to voice calls, you will need an AMBE decoder. There are two option:
 - Use tnt's open source AMBE decoder: http://git.osmocom.org/osmo-ir77/tree/codec
 - Extract an AMBE decoder from a firmware binary. Have a look at the [documentation](ambe_emu/Readme.md) in the `ambe_emu/` directory.

The easier option is to use tnt's AMBE decoder. You can use the extracted decoder if you want to create bit correct output. There almost no audible difference between the two options. Make sure that either `ir77_ambe_decode` or `ambe` is in your `PATH`. Also select the installed one in `play-iridium-ambe`.

Make sure that the main folder of the toolkit is in your `PATH` variable: `export PATH=$PATH:<this directory>`

Steps to decode voice:
 - Decode your captured and demodulated bits using `iridium-parser` and put the result into a file: `pypy iridium-parser.py output.bits > output.parsed`
 - Use `voc-stats.py` to see streams of captured voice frames: `./voc-stats.py  output.parsed`
 - Click once left and once right to select an area. `voc-stats.py` will try do decode and play the selected samples using the `play-iridium-ambe` script.


### Main Components

#### Detector
`detector-fft.py`

Searches through the file in 1 ms steps to scan for activity
and copies these parts into snippets called `<rawfilename>-<timestamp>.det`

#### Cut and Downmix

`cut-and-downmix.py`

Mixes the signal down to 0 Hz and cuts the beginning to match
the signal exactly. Output is `<detfile>-f<frequency>.cut`

#### Demod

`demod.py`

Does manual DQPSK demodulation of the signal to stdout.
If enabled inside `demod.py` it also outputs
`<cutfile>.peaks` (for debugging)
`<cutfile>.data` the raw bit stream.

#### Parser

`iridium-parser.py`

Takes the demodulated bits and tries to parse them into a readable format.

Supports some different output formats (`-o` option).
